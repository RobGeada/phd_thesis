 I would foremost like to acknowledge the contributions of my supervisors to this work; they were ever-present to
 focus my thoughts into concrete ideas. Their guidance was crucial in shaping this work's over-arching aims,
 helping me develop a cohesive argument from a mountain of experimental results as well as identify the directions
 that new experiments needed to take. Second, I would like to thank Red Hat, for providing the funding by which this project
 came to fruition. Red Hat offered me a flexible support structure and treated my PhD
 research with equal respect to my work responsibilities, for which I am forever grateful. Finally,
 I would like to acknowledge Paul Watson, Jennifer Wood, and the rest of the CDT family for creating the
 supportive and inquisitive environment that encouraged me to push myself to the fullest.
